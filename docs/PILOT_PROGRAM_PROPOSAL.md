## 3. Problem Statement

South African education faces significant challenges:

1.  **Socio-Economic Inequality**: A vast gap exists between well-resourced urban schools and under-resourced rural schools.
2.  **High Crime Rate**: Device theft is a major barrier to digital learning, with learners and educators being targeted.
3.  **Lack of Resources**: Many schools lack basic infrastructure, technology, and educational resources.
4.  **Digital Divide**: Limited internet access and high data costs exclude many learners from online learning opportunities.
5.  **Teacher Burnout**: Educators are overworked and lack the tools to provide personalized support to every learner.
