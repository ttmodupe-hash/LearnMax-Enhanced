## Q&A Preparation

### Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: How much does this cost per student?**  
**A**: "We're committed to affordability and are exploring government partnerships, subsidies, and tiered pricing to ensure accessibility. Our goal is universal access, not profit maximization."

**Q: What about students without computers?**  
**A**: "The platform works on low-spec devices, tablets, and shared school computers. We're also developing a mobile app. Additionally, offline mode means students can use school computers during the day and sync later."

**Q: How do you ensure CAPS alignment?**  
**A**: "Every exercise is mapped to specific CAPS curriculum references. We work with educators to ensure content accuracy and relevance. All exercises are reviewed by subject matter experts."

**Q: What about teacher training?**  
**A**: "We provide comprehensive training materials, video tutorials, and ongoing support. The interface is intuitive enough that tech-savvy students can often guide their peers (Ubuntu in action!)."

**Q: How do you handle data privacy (POPIA compliance)?**  
**A**: "All student data is encrypted, anonymized where possible, and stored securely. We comply fully with POPIA requirements. Parents/guardians provide explicit consent for data collection."

**Q: Can this replace teachers?**  
**A**: "Absolutely not. This is a tool to empower teachers, not replace them. Teachers guide, mentor, and provide the human connection that technology cannot. Virtual Labs handles repetitive practice and assessment, freeing teachers for higher-value interactions."

**Q: What about students with disabilities?**  
**A**: "We're committed to accessibility. Future versions will include screen reader support, adjustable font sizes, colorblind modes, and keyboard-only navigation. Feedback from special needs educators is welcome."

**Q: How do you prevent cheating?**  
**A**: "The focus is on learning, not just scores. Randomized problems, time tracking, and AI analysis of attempt patterns help identify genuine understanding vs. guessing. But ultimately, students who cheat only cheat themselves."

**Q: What's the internet bandwidth requirement?**  
**A**: "Very low. Initial download of exercises requires bandwidth, but after that, everything works offline. Sync uploads are small (just progress data). Designed specifically for low-bandwidth environments."

**Q: When can we pilot this in schools?**  
**A**: "We're ready for pilot programs now. We'd love to partner with the DBE to select pilot schools across urban and rural areas, gather feedback, and refine the platform before broader rollout."
